Unity game made for a special summer game jam to raise awareness for the BLM movement, focused around themes of equality, diversity, opportunity, justice, and inclusivity. I wrote all of the C# scripts and in-engine programming during this 66 hour jam. My scripts can be found in Assets/Scripts. 

To play the game, download and unzip the build file.
